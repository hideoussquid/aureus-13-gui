Aureus Core 0.13.2
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[Aureus Core](http://aureus.org/en/download) is the original Aureus client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Aureus transactions (which is currently several GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Aureus on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/aureus-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/aureusd` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run aureus-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag Aureus-Core to your applications folder, and then run Aureus-Core.
